<h3>Instructions: </h3>
<p>Please complete the following exercises using JavaScript loops as indicated.  Please place your code on this page. Use runtime scripts unless told otherwise. </p>
<p>1. Create a WHILE loop that will print out the  numbers 0 to 4 each on a seperate line.</p>
    <script>
      //While runs until the condition becomes false
        let i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
            document.write(i + "<br>");
            i++;
        }
    </script>
<p>2. Create a FOR loop that will print out the  numbers 4 to 0 each on a seperate line.</p>
    <script>
        //A for loop includes both the condition and the means to update
        for (let k = 4; k >= 0; k--) {
            document.write(k + "<br>");
        }
    </script>
<p>3. Create a loop that will print 1 to 5 each in its own paragraph element.</p>
    <script>
        //Use the document.write method to print each number to the browser
        for (let j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
            document.write("<p>Paragraph Number " + j + "</p>");
        }
    </script>
<p>4. Create a loop that will print out the following numbers (5,10,15,20,25...) until one is greater than 40.</p>
    <script>
        //Set the increment to 5 and stop when 40 is reached
        let count = 5;
        while (count <= 40) {
            document.write(count + " ");
            count += 5;
        }
    </script>
<p>5. Create a loop that will print out  6 of the following messages (Option 1, Option 2, Option 3, etc. ) as options within the drop down menu below.</p>
<p>
  <label>Select an Option! 
    <select name="select" id="select">
    </select>
  </label>
</p>
    <script>      
        //Locate the element in the menu
        let menu = document.getElementById("selectMenu");

        //Get fancy by looping 6 times (better than hardcoding)
        for (let opt = 1; opt <= 6; opt++) {
            menu.innerHTML += "<option value='" + opt + "'>Option " + opt + "</option>";
        }
    </script>
